Stuff I use all the time and every once in a while I need to copy to a new machine

- The bin folder contains random utilities place them on the home folder and add do PATH=$PATH:~/bin to your .zshrc
  - ColorPicker.app, allows you to spotlight and open a color picker
- tsconfig is the standard tsconfig that I use for most projects (if you don't `strict` you are a disgrace to your family)
- Bullet-train theme I like and removed the stupid characters that make pointy things, utterly supperflous
- Settings.json is the visual studio code config
