# Some useful files

- .bash_profile <- self explanatory
- functionalSnippet <- small snippet for JS ES5 that shows refactoring from imperative to functional
- keyboard-en.plist <- mapping for mac os keyboad to get rid of useless characters and show only latin/german chars, follow this tut: http://weblog.masukomi.org/2015/12/13/esperanto-press-and-hold-characters/
- shortcuts <- shortcuts I use day to day on certain programs I use
- settings.json <- settings for vscode

TODO:
- Create a bash script for initializing installation on new macs (ALWAYS USEFUL, ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT, NEVER HAD THE TIME)
- I had an automator file for opening my whole work flow, need to bring that back somewhow
- I have a bunch of insides into JS lately, including React and ES5, need to add them here
- Maybe some babelrc, webpack, eslint, docker files, setting this up on every project is always a pain
- Some Vagrant config? this seems to be not so relevant in recent years, docker took over
